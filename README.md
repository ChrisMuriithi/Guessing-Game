## ðŸŽ® Guessing Game Project ðŸŽ¯

This is a simple **Python guessing game** that demonstrates the use of **while loops, conditionals, and list operations**.  
The game picks a **random number between 1 and 100**, and the player tries to guess the number with feedback after every guess.

### ðŸš€ Key Features:
- Validates user input.
- Provides hints:  
  â†’ "WARM" if your first guess is close, "COLD" if far.  
  â†’ "WARMER" if you're getting closer, "COLDER" if you're getting farther.
- Counts the number of guesses taken to arrive at the correct number.

### ðŸ§© Concepts Practiced:
- `while` loops
- `if, elif, else` statements
- `break, continue` control flow
- `list` operations
- `input()` and user interaction
- Random number generation

### âœ… How to Run:
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run:
```bash
python guessing_game.py
```

Enjoy and test how fast you can guess the number! ðŸ”¥
